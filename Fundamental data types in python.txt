Fundamental data types:
Fundamental data types are immutable. Once an object is created, we cannot perform any changes in the object. If we want to change, a new object is created.

1)Str - String data type. sequence of characters enclosed within single double or triple quotes. 

Example:

a = 'Hello students'
print(a)


2)Int - represent whole numbers

b = 44
x = 55
print(b+x)


3)float - represents floating point values

e = 24.4
x = 22.0
print(e+x)


4)Bool

True/False - True takes 1 and False is 0

Example:

e = 24.4
x = 22.0
c = e==x
print(c)

5)Complex- complex data type has "real part" and "imaginary part" 
a + bj

Type Casting:
Following are various inbuilt functions available for type casting in python 

1) int()
2) float()
3) complex()
4) bool()
5) str()
